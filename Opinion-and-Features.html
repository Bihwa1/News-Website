                    <p>
                        Two construction workers have been rescued after becoming trapped outside the 
                        eighth floor of a building in Sacramento, California.
                        
                        On Wednesday, Feb. 18, the Sacramento Fire Department revealed on X 
                        (formerly known as Twitter) that officials responded to an incident of 
                        two workers “hanging off the side of an eight- story building.”
                        
                        The department said that the workers were able to be “safely” lowered to the 
                        ground, adding that no injuries were reported.
                        
                        Footage shared by the officials showed rescuers helping the construction staff 
                        to descend from the building.
                        
                        PEOPLE has reached out to the Sacramento Fire Department and the Occupational 
                        Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), but didn't immediately receive 
                        responses.

                    <p>
                        The workers had been installing protective netting on the side of the building 
                        when the scaffolding broke, the fire department told CBS News and Fox40.com.
                        
                        “The scaffolding had a malfunction either in its motor or braking system,” 
                        Sacramento Fire Chief Chris Costamagna told Fox40.com. “So one side of the 
                        scaffolding got way out of balance.” 

                        After realizing that they wouldn't be able to align a ladder truck below the 
                        stranded workers, rescuers went to the roof of the building to rescue the 
                        constructors.
                        
                        “What we were able to do is get our rescue company above them, hooking into 
                        them with our equipment,” Chief Costamagna told Fox40.com. 

                        The rescue took around 30 minutes, the outlet reported.

                        The article reflects on the shocking killing of a 12-year-old girl in
                        Toledo City who was found dead after being reported missing, with her own uncle 
                        suspected of the crime. Authorities are still investigating the circumstances, 
                        including whether rape or drugs were involved, and officials have called for a 
                        thorough probe. The tragedy has drawn comparisons to past cases of violence 
                        against young girls, including the rape and murder of 10-year-old Kiara Namanama 
                        in 2022 and the still-unsolved killing of six-year-old Ellah Joy Pique in 2011. 
                        The piece expresses sympathy for the victims' families and calls for swift 
                        justice.

                        It emphasizes that children are especially vulnerable to violent crimes because 
                        of their trust in adults and inability to defend themselves. While children are 
                        often taught to avoid strangers, the article points out that danger can also 
                        come from familiar faces, including neighbors or relatives. It also notes how 
                        negative influences such as drugs and alcohol may contribute to such crimes. 
                        Without blaming the victim's parents, the article stresses the importance of 
                        constant vigilance and awareness of children's whereabouts to help protect them 
                        from harm.
