            <h1>The Philippines in 2026: Can Marcos Restore Public Trust? </h1>

                    <p> In 2025, large-scale corruption triggered massive protests across the Philippines, 
                        which severely eroded public trust in the government and undermined the 
                        presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Can Marcos restore confidence and stability 
                        in his leadership this year?

                        Marcos signed the General Appropriations Act on January 5, which prevented a 
                        re-enacted budget as he vowed to combat corruption in the bureaucracy. 
                        He assured the public that the budget does not contain anomalous insertions and 
                        programs that were previously misused by corrupt lawmakers. He added that the 
                        distribution of cash assistance and other relief measures will be done without 
                        the intervention of politicians.
                    </p>

                    <p> But critics pointed out that pork barrel funds are embedded in various agencies, 
                        ensuring the “allocables” of Congress members. Unprogrammed appropriations are 
                        lower this year, but the fund item is still viewed as a tool for political 
                        patronage since only the president can order its release.

                        Doubts persist about the government's anti-corruption drive because of the 
                        apparent preservation of the controversial pork barrel system in the budget, and 
                        also the failure to indict and detain high-ranking officials implicated in the 
                        flood control scandal. It was Marcos who announced that elected officials and 
                        masterminds of infrastructure corruption would spend Christmas in jail. The 
                        failure to hold these officials accountable in 2025 could further diminish the 
                        government's credibility in ending impunity and corruption.

                    <p> MANILA, Philippines — Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto on Thursday filed a complaint 
                        before the Commission on Elections (Comelec) against contractor Sarah Discaya 
                        for alleged overspending during the campaign period and perjury in relation to 
                        the 2025 midterm elections. 

                        Sotto personally lodged the complaint before the Political Finance and Affairs 
                        Department of Comelec, accompanied by his election lawyer Atty. Romulo Macalintal.
                        Sotto and Discaya were rivals in the last elections.

                    <p><i> think it's clear and blatant violations of election law. In fact, I don't want 
                        to do this, but we want everyone in Pasig City to abide by the law. You need to 
                        obey the election laws,” Sotto told reporters in an interview.></i>
                    </p>

                    <p> Sotto is charging Discaya for alleged violations of the Omnibus Election Code and 
                        Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code for alleged untruthful declaration of 
                        campaign expenditure and alleged false entries in her statement of contribution 
                        and expenditure (SOCE). </p>
                    
                    <p><i>“I am executing this Complaint-Affidavit to attest to the truth of the foregoing 
                        allegations and to charge respondent CEZARAH ROWENA C. DISCAYA with probable 
                        violation of: (a) Section 100 in relation to Section 262 of the OEC 
                        [Omnibus Election Code], as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act No. 7166 for 
                        campaign spending in excess of the amount authorized by law,”</i> the complaint read.
                        Sotto is also suing Discaya for allegedly breaching <i>“(b) Article 183 of the 
                        Revised Penal Code, for knowingly making false and material statements under 
                        oath in her SOCE, in violation of election laws, and/or for such other 
                        appropriate crimes that the foregoing acts may constitute,”</i> the complaint read. 
                        In his complaint, Sotto said that Discaya went beyond the limit of the 
                        contribution and expenditure amount authorized by the law under 
                        Republic Act No. 7166. </p>
