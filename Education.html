                        MANILA, Philippines — Failing students would mean an additional burden to 
                        teachers and put them at risk of losing their incentives solely based on their 
                        performances as instructors, factors that forced them to pass learners despite 
                        lacking the necessary skills, a teachers' group said on Wednesday.
                        
                        The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) voiced its sentiments over the findings 
                        by the Second Congressional Commission on Education about the “mass promotion” 
                        of students or advancing learners to the next grade level despite underperforming 
                        in classrooms.
                        
                        The mass promotion of students itself was a result of “structural failures” that 
                        long plagued the education system and it should not be looked as if it was only 
                        a “compliance problem,” according to ACT chair Ruby Bernardo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bernardo was responding to the findings by the Second Congressional Commission 
                        on Education (Edcom 2) over learners' mass promotion, resulting in students 
                        moving up to the next grade level but not equipped with the necessary skills, 
                        such as in literacy and mathematics.
                        
                        She noted that while the findings are valid, the problem of mass promotion 
                        should not heavily rely on the issue of being a compliance or standards problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <i>“In the current system, failing students would only mean additional burden for 
                        teachers such as home visits, talking to parents, remedial classes and heavy 
                        documentation workload,”</i> Bernardo said in a statement in Filipino.
                        
                        <i>“If many students will fail, the discussion will also have to center on the 
                        school's image and the incentives tied to [the teachers'] performance, which 
                        means that the system itself is pushing [teachers] to pass students despite 
                        being unprepared [for the next grade level],”</i> she pointed out.

                        <strong>ILOILO CITY</strong> - The country needs more volunteers not only for social welfare, 
                        but other sectors as well, like education and disaster response.
                        
                        This was highlighted Wednesday during the opening ceremony of the National 
                        Volunteers Month celebration here, with the theme "Volunteerism for Inclusive 
                        Development: Empowering Communities, Building a Just and Resilient Future."
                        
                        In an interview, Philippine National Volunteer Services Coordinating Agency 
                        executive director Donald James Gawe said they would like to align volunteerism 
                        with the development priority thrust of the government.
                        
                        <i>“There are studies that would show we have a high learning poverty. So, we need 
                        volunteers to help with literacy-reading, writing. Moreover, since we are a 
                        disaster-prone country, we need standby volunteers for response in the different
                        areas to address the effects of disasters,”</i> Gawe said.
                        
                        He added there is also a need for volunteers to assist or capacitate those 
                        looking for jobs or embarking on livelihood activities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gawe said they see <strong>Iloilo as a strong model for volunteerism</strong> and are looking 
                        forward for the local government to showcase its best practices during the 
                        celebrations.
                        
                        The Western Visayas Volunteerism Research Consortium, composed of higher 
                        education institutions, including the <i>University of San Agustin (USA), 
                        West Visayas State University, Iloilo Science and Technology University, 
                        St. Paul College of Iloilo, and the Central Philippine University, </i>

                        based in this city, helps promote volunteerism as a strategy of development, 
                        while the Iloilo Business Club strongly supports the initiative.

                    <p>
                        Mayor Raisa Treñas said the progress of Iloilo City is not because of the local 
                        government alone, but through partnerships and collaborations.
                        
                        “We have lots of programs that we involve our volunteers. And we continue to 
                        grow our volunteer network to make sure that whatever projects we have here in 
                        Iloilo, it will not only be effective, but we make sure that all our stakeholders 
                        are in touch with our projects,” she said in a press conference.
                        
                        She added <strong>volunteerism is “very hard” because volunteers do not have salaries.</strong>
                        
                        However, the city government recognized its volunteers, and they are one in 
                        vision for the greater good of the city.

                        Development Growth Carlos Bernardo Abad Santos said volunteerism is harnessing 
                        the private sector, communities and other sectors to be able to contribute to 
                        national development.
                        As part of the celebration, there will be a two-day volunteerism focal point 
                        systems summit starting Thursday, where advocates will share their experiences 
                        and how to institutionalize volunteerism in their organization.
                        
                        There will also be a volunteer fair in various parts of the country; an online 
                        celebration of the International Volunteer's Day on Dec.5; a research conference
                        in Cebu; a consultation with upland communities in Kabakalan Negros Occidental; 
                        and the awarding of outstanding volunteers in Manila on Dec. 16. (PNA)
