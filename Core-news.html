            <h1>Families of Philippine drug war victims seek ICC justice as Duterte trial looms</h1>

                    <p> Mary Ann Pajo stood silently as workers at a Manila cemetery opened her son's grave and exhumed his body so a forensic pathologist could examine it. Her son, 30-year-old Joewarski Pajo, had been accused of drug dealing.
                        He was fatally shot while playing a game on his phone—one of the thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings carried out during the anti-drug campaign of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte.
                        On Monday, the International Criminal Court will begin a hearing to decide whether Duterte should face trial over at least 76 of those deaths.
                        Hopes that he would attend in person faded on Friday after ICC judges ruled that the 80-year-old could choose not to appear.
                        In a recent filing requesting to be excused, Duterte wrote, “I am old, tired and frail.”
                    </p>

                    <p> Father Flavie Villanueva criticized the request, calling it cowardly and pointing out that Duterte had already been deemed fit to stand trial. “Accountability is something this person has no concept of,” he said.
                        At a Manila café run by relatives of victims of the drug war, three staff members said they 
                        doubted justice could ever have been achieved within the Philippines. Lydjay Acopio, whose 
                        three-year-old daughter Myca was killed during a police raid on her home, said, “No one in
                        the Philippines can lay hands on Duterte, much less file cases against him.”

                    <p> Meanwhile, public support for trying Duterte at the ICC has declined.
                        A November survey by Manila-based WR Numero found that 44 percent of 
                        Filipinos believe he should face trial there, down from 62 percent in April.

                <h1>In Depth: Fake "breaking news" on YouTube muddle info on Senate, House power shift amid flood control mess</h1>

                    <p> Fake “breaking news” videos on YouTube are distorting public understanding
                        of the leadership shake-ups in both the Senate and House of Representatives
                        following the revelations in congressional inquiries into alleged corrupt 
                        flood-control projects.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The public remains glued to probes on massive corruption
                        in flood-control projects, which have already triggered leadership changes
                        in both the Senate and the House. This subset of disinformation that PressOne.
                        PH calls news-cycle disinformation could potentially distort how people 
                        remember these events and could shape perceptions ahead of the crucial 
                        presidential election in 2028.</p>
                    
                    <p> <strong>What we know so far: </strong>News-cycle disinformation involves fabricated claims that 
                        latch on to an unfolding news event, presenting themselves as breaking updates 
                        within the same cycle (or immediately after), and reporting false, premature, 
                        or implausible outcomes..</p>

                    <p> <strong>Catch up quick: </strong>The two chambers of Congress launched probes into alleged 
                        anomalies in flood-control projects, following President Ferdinand 
                        “Bongbong” Marcos Jr State of the Nation Address where he disclosed 
                        that only 15 contractors have cornered huge contracts with the Department 
                        of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). 
                        <ul>
                            <li class="specific-li-tag">The Senate's probe intensified after contractor couple Pacifico and Sarah Discaya linked to flood control anomalies a list of congressmen, including then-House speaker <strong>Martin Romualdez.</strong> The lawmakers were behind multi-billion peso kickback schemes, they claimed.</li>
                            <li class="specific-li-tag"><strong>Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Joel Villanueva</strong> were implicated in alleged DPWH corruption, while then-Senate president Chiz Escudero was named in a House hearing as having received millions in campaign funds from a contractor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p> <strong>What we found:</strong> PressOne.PH has been tracking several YouTube channels involved 
                        in news-cycle disinformation since July 2025 following Marcos Jr. 's address, 
                        where he mandated an audit of all flood control projects.
