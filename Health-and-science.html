                        <strong>MANILA, Philippines </strong>—The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday warned of a possible 
                        outbreak of measles-rubella in Mindanao due to low vaccination.
                        
                        In a statement, the agency said about 520,646 children aged 5 and below remained 
                        unvaccinated following the conclusion of its “Ligtas Tigdas” campaign.
                        
                        Around 2.3 million children—or 82 percent of the target population—were 
                        vaccinated during the campaign.
                        
                        The agency said that it needed at least 95 percent to reach herd immunity or to 
                        mitigate the spread of the virus.

                        Mental health has a cost, but ignoring it costs even more. MindNation co-founder 
                        Cat Triviño talks to Rappler about how the Philippines can improve access to care.
                        MANILA, Philippines - As Mental Health Awareness Month comes to a close, 

                        the struggles of Filipinos don't end in October — many continue to face stress, 
                        burnout, and emotional exhaustion, often quietly and with shame.
                        
                        In the Philippines, the cost of mental health isn't just financial.
                        It's emotional, physical, and social; from the stigma that keeps people from 
                        seeking help, to the lack of access that makes care feel out of reach.
                        
                        Cat Triviño, co-founder of MindNation and long-time mental health advocate, 
                        discusses with Rappler the systemic limitations the Philippines faces when it 
                        comes to mental health and how we can make care more accessible.
