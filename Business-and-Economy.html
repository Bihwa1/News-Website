            <h1>Finance Sec. Go: PH economy to bounce back, to grow by at least 5% in 2026 </h1>

                    <p> MANILA -- Finance Secretary Frederick Go is optimistic the Philippine economy can 
                        bounce back again this year, even saying the country's gross domestic product 
                        will hit at least the low end of the government's revised target of 
                        <strong>5 to 6 percent.</strong>
                        <i>“For 2026, we will bounce back and we will definitely have a GDP of at least 
                        5 percent. Of course we're working towards a 5 plus percent GDP growth for 2026,” </i>
                        he said.
                        Go, speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines, said 
                        the country's growth in 2025 was hampered by several factors, both domestic 
                        issues and external risks.
                        
                        <i>“Flood control expose, the global events like the reciprocal tariffs as well as 
                        natural disasters that hit the Philippines. We're so used to typhoons, but I 
                        guess we're not used to earthquakes, and all these events in the second half of 
                        last year affected our GDP growth,”</i> Go said.
                        
                        One of the things that could help lift the economy up, Go said, is the resolution 
                        of the flood control scandal and the return of the stolen money to the 
                        government.
                    </p>

                    <p> <i>“The solution is simply prosecution, restitution, and genuine reforms. 
                        The people want to see people punished and go to jail,”</i> he said.
                        He added that the country's strong fundamentals, like easing inflation and good 
                        credit ratings will also help beef up the economy again. 
                        Several reforms have also started, like new laws or amendments to laws have been
                        passed— like the New Public-Private Partnership Code, Investors' Lease Act, 
                        Accelerated and Reformed Right-of-Way Act, among others.
                        
                        He also says the government is spending more efficiently this year. 
                        The government is set to spend P1.4 trillion in the first quarter to stimulate 
                        the economy.
                        
                        <i>“Reminding all my fellow cabinet members about smart spending, spending 
                        fficiently, and making sure that we spend projects with the highest multiplier 
                        effects,”</i> Go said.

                <h1>Stock Market News for Feb 18, 2026 </h1>
                <h3>Zacks Equity Research</h3>
                <p>Published: Wed, February 18, 2026 at 5:44 PM GMT+8</p>

                    <p> U.S. stock markets closed higher on Tuesday. Stock prices were muted yesterday 
                        as major indexes were mostly sidetracked. Strong fourth-quarter 2025 earnings 
                        results failed to enthuse market participants due to artificial intelligence 
                        (AI)-related disruption fears. However, all three major stock indexes ended in 
                        positive territory.
                    </p>

                    <h2>AI Setback Continues</h2>
                    <p> Investors have been rotating out of tech stocks on growing concerns over the 
                        downsides of AI stocks.
                        On Tuesday, the selloff continued as fears grew over the potential of AI stocks 
                        compared to the billions of dollars pumped into the sector.  
                        Some sections of the stock market have suffered this year following the rollout 
                        of AI tools that threaten to copy what they do or eat into their profit margins. 
                        Financial stocks, especially, have been feeling the heat on concerns that AI 
                        could hamper wealth management businesses. 
                        
                        Several other sectors, such as media, trucking and real estate, also suffered 
                        due to AI disruption fears. Major software developers are also bearing the 
                        brunt of AI fear as market participants remained highly concerned that AI tools
                        will replace industry-specific software that these developers are providing.
