                    <p> MANILA - A ranking official of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on 
                        Thursday said the country is facing "persistent cyber attacks" linked to its 
                        territorial dispute with China regarding the West Philippine Sea (WPS).
                        
                        AFP Cyber Command chief Brig. Gen. Joey Fontiveros, however, assured the public 
                        that government measures are in place to address issues arising from these 
                        threats.
                        
                        He said the Department of National Defense and the AFP view cybersecurity as 
                        integral to national security, given the reliance on information systems for 
                        territorial integrity and economic stability.
                        
                        <i>"Government responses include the National Cyber Security Plan, which emphasizes 
                        advanced threat assessment, capacity building and closing skills gaps to bolster 
                        resilience,"</i> he said at a Stratbase Institute forum dubbed "Navigating Digital 
                        Crossroads: Advancing Cybersecurity and Democratic Resilience in the 
                        Indo-Pacific."
                    </p>

                    <p>The military official said these threats have been intensified, contributing 
                        to a broader global risk profile where misinformation, disinformation, and 
                        cyber insecurity rank among top short and long-term concerns.
                        
                        <i>"From a security and defense viewpoint, the country faces persistent cyber 
                        attacks linked to territorial disputes in the WPS with China-based malicious 
                        actors deploying malware, DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, data 
                        leaks and website compromises to advance Beijing's regional ambition," </i>
                        Fontiveros said.
                        
                        This year, Fontiveros said the Philippines' cybersecurity landscape is 
                        characterized by escalating threats driven by geopolitical tensions, 
                        rapid digital transformation and a sophisticated adversary environment, 
                        particularly from state-sponsored actors.

                    <p>
                        While the Philippines has detected foreign attempts to access intelligence data, 
                        the AFP official said no major breaches have been confirmed, though he 
                        underscored vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure like healthcare, 
                        transportation and power grids.
                        
                        <i>"Overall, the landscape demands a shift from reactive to proactive defenses, 
                        integrating AI (artificial intelligence)-powered detection and multilateral 
                        cooperation to counter hybrid threats in a digitally interconnected region,"</i>
                        Fontiveros said.
                        
                        To better secure the country's cyberspace, Fontiveros said the AFP has 
                        prioritized cyber defense as a core component of its modernization under the 
                        Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept as the military now recognizes cyber 
                        threats as equivalent to physical ones in modern warfare.

                    <p>
                        If you know what to listen for, a person's voice can tell you about their 
                        education level, emotional state and even profession and finances — more so 
                        than you could imagine. Now, scientists posit that technology in the form of 
                        voice-to-text recordings can be used in price gouging, unfair profiling, 
                        harassment or stalking.
                        
                        While humans might be attuned to more obvious cues such as fatigue, nervousness, 
                        happiness and so on, computers can do the same, but with far more information, 
                        and much faster. A new study claims intonation patterns or your choice of words 
                        can reveal everything from your personal politics to the presence of health or 
                        medical conditions.
                        
                        The research, published Nov. 19, 2025 in the journal Proceedings of the IEEE, 
                        highlights a grave concern for the technology's capability in privacy and unfair 
                        profiling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While voice processing and recognition technology present opportunities, 
                        Aalto University's speech and language technology associate professor 
                        <strong>Tom Bäckström,</strong> lead author of the study, sees the potential for serious risks 
                        and harms. If a corporation understands your economic situation or needs from 
                        your voice, for instance, it opens the door to price gouging, like discriminatory 
                        insurance premiums.
                        
                        And when voices can reveal details like emotional vulnerability, gender and 
                        other personal details, cybercriminals or stalkers can identify and track victims 
                        across platforms and expose them to extortion or harassment. These are all 
                        details we transmit subconsciously when we speak and which we unconsciously 
                        respond to before anything else.
