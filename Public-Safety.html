                        MANILA - The shear line, northeast monsoon or amihan, and easterlies will 
                        bring rains over parts of the country, the weather bureau said Sunday.
                        
                        The Eastern Visayas, Central Visayas, Misamis Oriental, Camiguin, 
                        Surigao del Norte, and Dinagat Islands will have cloudy skies with scattered 
                        rains and isolated thunderstorms due to the shear line.
                        
                        The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration 
                        (PAGASA), in its 4 a.m. advisory, said flash floods or landslides may occur due 
                        to moderate to at times heavy rains in these areas.
                        
                        Cagayan, Isabela, and Aurora will experience cloudy skies with light rains 
                        while Metro Manila, the rest of Luzon, and the rest of Visayas will have 
                        isolated light rains due to amihan.
                        
                        The rest of Mindanao will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated 
                        rain showers or thunderstorms caused by easterlies.
                        
                        Moderate to strong northeast winds and moderate to rough seas will prevail over 
                        the eastern sections of Southern Luzon and Visayas.
                        
                        The rest of the country will have light to moderate east to northeast winds 
                        and slight to moderate coastal waters. (PNA)

            <h1>MMDA urges public to use mass transport as traffic jams expected during Christmas season</h1>
            <h3> Aaron Recuenco</h3>
            <p>Published:  Dec 10, 2025 05:31 pm </p>
            <div class="general-container">

                    <p>
                        The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) urged commuters to use mass 
                        transportation system to decongest roads in Metro Manila of motor vehicles, which 
                        is one of the major reasons behind monstrous traffic jams during the Christmas
                        season.
                         
                        MMDA chairman Don Artes said the volume of motor vehicles on major thoroughfares,
                        particularly EDSA, has already exceeded its capacity and the increase in the 
                        volume during Holiday season is causing traffic congestion.
                        
                        In a press briefing, Artes revealed that around 450,000 motor vehicles were 
                        recorded along EDSA alone, which he said, is more than the 250,000 capacity.
                        
                        To manage the high vehicular volume, Artes said the MMDA has implemented 
                        adjustments which include coordinating with the Department of Transportation
                    </p>

                        (DOTr) to extend operating hours of the MRT and LRT and other public transport systems.
                        
                        “This is aimed at encouraging the public not to use their private vehicles, 
                        said Artes.
                        
                        He said this will be complemented with the aggressive clearing operations of 
                        Mabuhay Lanes, which are designated alternate routes to help motorists
                        
                        avoid congested main roads like EDSA.
                        
                        Other measures include asking mall operators to refrain from holding mall-wide 
                        sale events during peak holiday hours.
