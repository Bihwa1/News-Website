                    <h1>Apocalypse Now (1979)</h1>

                    <p>
                        Based only on his collaborations with Francis Ford Coppola, actor Robert Duvall, 
                        who passed away this week at age 95, would be considered one of the great actors 
                        of his generation. Duvall asked Coppola to make his Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore 
                        less one-dimensional, and the commander is slightly more humane in the extended 
                        “Redux” version released in 2001. Moments of humanity aside, however, Kilgore is 
                        a swaggering personification of America's doomed foreign policy during the 
                        Vietnam War. “I love the smell of napalm in the morning,” says it all.

                        Richard Linklater made one of my favorite movies of 2025 with this biopic of 
                        lyricist Lorenz Hart, whose name has been largely forgotten thanks to Hart's 
                        Broadway partner Richard Rodgers finding greater success with Oscar Hammerstein. 
                        Filmed entirely in a single bar, Ethan Hawke brings deep, agonizing pathos to 
                        the role of Hart, regaling anyone who will listen with stories of his past 
                        glories and of future dreams that will clearly never come to fruition.

                        Following the success of “Prey,” Dan Trachtenberg helmed another inventive 
                        entry in the Predator series, putting a teen predator 
                        (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) and a Weyland Yutani android (Elle Fanning) on 
                        the same team as the extraterrestrial attempts to complete a coming-of-age ritual 
                        killing.

                    <h1>The Last Thing He Told Me (Season 2)</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of Bostonians' favorite books of the last few years was Laura Dave's 
                        “The Last Thing He Told Me,” which was turned into an Apple TV series starring 
                        Jennifer Garner. The show is back for Season 2, this time adapting Dave's sequel 
                        novel “The First Time I Saw Him,” and deepening the story of Hannah (Garner), her 
                        missing husband (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), and his daughter (Angourie Rice).

                    <h1>The Night Agent (Season 3)</h1>
                    <p>
                        The first two seasons of “The Night Agent” were pretty straightforward spy 
                        thriller material, but with enough subtle flourishes to elevate the material. 
                        This season, the titular night agent, Peter (Gabriel Basso, “Hillbilly Elegy”), 
                        is headed to Istanbul to track down a Treasury Agent who has fled the country 
                        with sensitive intelligence.
